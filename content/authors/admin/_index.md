## Hello!

I am a current M.Eng student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT conducting research on scalable, adaptive, and efficient wireless tactile sensing. I am interested in developing intelligent wearable systems using textile-integrated electronics, low-power wireless communication protocols, and multimodal signal processing and machine learning. On this page you can find past projects I've worked on, as well as my current resume. Feel free to contact me at devinmur@mit.edu about anything you find here!

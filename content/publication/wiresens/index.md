abstract: Tactile sensors present a powerful means of capturing, analyzing, and augmenting human-environment interactions. Accelerated by advancements in design and manufacturing, resistive matrix-based sensing has emerged as a promising method for developing scalable and robust tactile sensors. However, the development of portable, adaptive, and long lasting resistive tactile sensing systems remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce WiReSens Toolkit. Our platform provides open-source hardware and software libraries to configure multi-sender, power-efficient, and adaptive wireless tactile sensing systems in as fast as ten minutes. We demonstrate our platformâ€™s flexibility by using it to prototype several applications such as musical gloves, gait monitoring shoe soles, and IoT-enabled smart home systems.

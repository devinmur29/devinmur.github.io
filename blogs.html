            07/21/22: Maybe I should date these! I think I will just write them inside an html document for now.
            <br>
            I think it adds to the homemadeness maybe.
            <br>
            I also think I should just focus on having ~something~. I spent hours making the little boat thing lol.

        <li>
            There are so many fun fonts that will never get used :/
            Can you take me seriously with this font?
            Do I want people to take me seriously?
        </li>
        <li>The first blog I'll write here. I have spent ~ an hr on this site so far. All it has is 
            a home page and these blogs. I'm writing this in an html file, which probably isn't the best way to do this.
            I could feel myself getting frustrated setting this up.
            I don't want that to stop me from doing it.
            <br>
            I'm gonna try to do everything by hand.
            <br>
            I'm gonna try to use as little JS as possible.
            <br> 
            Do i really have to copy my navbar onto every page?
        </li>
